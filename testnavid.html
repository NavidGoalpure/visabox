      <h2>Australian Skills Assessment Authority: VETASSESS</h2>
      <p>
        Australian Skills Assessment Authority, VETASSESS, assesses and
        evaluates a wide range of professional fields. VETASSESS evaluates
        occupations related to sports, marketing, agriculture, management, as
        well as fields like microbiology, biochemistry, and many others. With
        VETASSESS, you do not need a language score to start the process. If you
        search for the term <em>VETASSESS OCCUPATION LIST</em> on Google or
        visit this
        <a
          href="https://www.vetassess.com.au/portals/0/downloads/qualification_assessment/vetassess-general-occupation-list.pdf?vid=100"
          >link</a
        >, you can see the conditions and requirements for each occupation
        assessed by VETASSESS. The organization classifies occupations into five
        groups based on their required educational level.
      </p>
      <h2>Group A</h2>
      <p>
        This group includes occupations where the applicant, for a positive
        assessment, must have an equivalent Australian Bachelor's degree or
        higher, and the educational qualification and work experience of the
        applicant must be directly relevant. Additionally, the applicant must
        have at least one year of relevant work experience in the last five
        years related to the occupation and their university degree.
      </p>
      <h2>Group B</h2>
      <p>
        This group includes occupations that require an equivalent Australian
        Bachelor's degree or higher. This group is further divided into three
        categories:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the educational qualification and work experience of the applicant
          are fully relevant, the applicant must have at least one year of work
          experience within the last five years since obtaining the degree.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the educational qualification and work experience of the applicant
          are semi-relevant, and the applicant holds a diploma equivalent to an
          Australian diploma that is fully related to the occupation, the
          applicant must have at least two years of work experience within the
          last five years since obtaining the diploma.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the educational qualification and work experience of the applicant
          are unrelated, the applicant must have at least three years of work
          experience within the last five years since obtaining the degree.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Calculation of Work Experience Before Obtaining the Degree:</strong
        >
        If all the work experience of the applicant is before obtaining the
        bachelor's degree, a total of 5 years of work experience related to the
        required degree is required. The applicant must also have worked for at
        least one year after obtaining the bachelor's degree.
      </p>
      <h2>Group C</h2>
      <p>
        This category includes jobs that require at least an
        <em>AQF Diploma</em>, and the applicant must have a minimum of one year
        of work experience after obtaining the diploma in the past five years.
        For this group of occupations, there are three scenarios based on the
        relationship between the job and the university degree:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the applicant's educational qualification and work experience are
          directly related, they must have a minimum of one year of work
          experience within the past five years after obtaining the diploma.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the applicant has another qualification equivalent to
          <em>AQF Certificate IV</em> in a closely related field, they must have
          a minimum of one year of work experience within the past five years
          after obtaining the diploma.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the applicant's educational qualification and work experience are
          unrelated, they must have a minimum of two years of work experience
          within the past five years after obtaining the diploma.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Calculation of Pre-Degree Work Experience:</strong> If all of
        the applicant's work experience is before obtaining the degree, a
        minimum of 5 years of work experience related to the required degree is
        required. The applicant must also have worked for at least one year
        after obtaining the degree.
      </p>
      <h2>Group D</h2>
      <p>
        This group includes occupations that require
        <em>AQF Certificate IV</em>. This group is divided into three
        categories:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the applicant's educational qualification and work experience are
          entirely relevant, the applicant must have a minimum of one year of
          work experience in the last five years after obtaining the degree.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the applicant's work experience is unrelated to their degree, the
          applicant must have a minimum of two years of work experience in the
          last five years after obtaining the degree.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the educational qualification is at the level of
          <em>AQF Certificate III</em> with work experience entirely relevant to
          the degree, the applicant must have a minimum of three years of work
          experience in the last five years after obtaining the degree.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <strong>Calculation of Pre-Qualification Work Experience:</strong> If
        all the work experience of the applicant before obtaining the
        <em>AQF Certificate III</em> or <em>Certificate IV</em> is equivalent,
        three years of work experience related to the degree before obtaining
        the degree is required. The applicant must also have a minimum of one
        year of work experience after obtaining the degree.
      </p>

      <h2>Group E</h2>
      <p>
        Includes occupations that require an <em>AQF Diploma</em>. The applicant
        must have a diploma that is completely relevant to the job, and during
        the last five years, the applicant must have a minimum of one year of
        work experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the advantages of credential assessment by this organization is
        the absence of the need for language proficiency documents. To have your
        documents assessed by VETASSESS Australia, applicants must select the
        relevant occupation code for their field and proceed accordingly.
        Choosing the most appropriate occupation code is of great importance. It
        has been observed that VETASSESS usually deducts one year from the
        provided work experience, even if all documents are accepted. This
        should be considered in presenting the intended work experience. The
        normal processing time for an assessment from VETASSESS is three to six
        months, and in the Fast Track option, it takes 10 to 20 days. The
        assessment fee for VETASSESS in 2023 is AUD 962 for regular processing
        and AUD 1585 for the Fast Track option. Note that extension of the
        assessment, or re-assessment, is not available in the Fast Track option.

      <h2>
        Australia Engineers Assessment Organization (<em>Engineers Australia</em
        >) or EA
      </h2>
      <p>
        This organization assesses and evaluates engineering documents. The
        assessment of engineering qualifications by Engineers Australia (EA)
        might be slightly more challenging compared to the Australian Computer
        Society (ACS) and VETASSESS. In addition to general documents and work
        experience, Engineers Australia requires applicants to submit a
        Competency Demonstration Report (CDR). CDR consists of five parts, and
        in the first three parts, you need to present three projects as an
        engineer, such as a work project, a research paper, or even a thesis. It
        is advisable to present at least one or two work projects, each
        consisting of an average of 2000 to 2500 words, written in a specialized
        language and in the format required by Engineers Australia (EA). After
        presenting three projects, you must provide Continuing Professional
        Development (CPD), which includes courses, seminars, or any material you
        have studied outside the academic course and is in line with improving
        your skills and maintaining your profession. In the last section, you
        must write a Summary Statement, and the format and writing instructions
        are available on the Engineers Australia (EA) website. Engineers
        Australia (EA) also requires an IELTS Academic or General certificate
        with a score of 6 or a PTE score of 50 in each skill. The result of the
        assessment of applicants' qualifications by Engineers Australia and the
        equivalence of their qualifications will be in one of the following
        states. The final result of the equivalence of educational
        qualifications in Australia depends on factors such as the type of
        qualification, university, location of study, and field of study.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Assessment of educational qualifications equivalent to Professional
          Engineer: In this case, the applicant's field is equivalent to Skill
          Level 1. The assessment of professional engineers means an equivalent
          of a 4-year bachelor's degree in Australia. This educational
          qualification equivalence will give the applicant
          <strong>15 points</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assessment of educational qualifications equivalent to Engineering
          Technologist: In this case, the applicant's field is equivalent to
          Skill Level 2. The assessment of engineering technologists means an
          equivalent of a 3-year bachelor's degree in Australia. This
          educational qualification equivalence will give the applicant
          <strong>10 points</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assessment of educational qualifications equivalent to Engineering
          Associate: In this case, the applicant's field is equivalent to a
          2-year diploma in Australia.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assessment of educational qualifications equivalent to Engineering
          Manager: The result of this case's equivalence is for individuals with
          a senior management work experience. In this case, the applicant's
          field is equivalent to Skill Level 1. This educational qualification
          equivalence will give the applicant <strong>15 points</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One noteworthy aspect based on applicants' experiences is that Engineers
        Australia (EA) usually does not deduct the number of years of
        applicants' work experience, and the work experience is calculated after
        obtaining the qualification. The response time of this organization is
        approximately 3 months, and the cost is
        <strong>825 Australian dollars</strong>. However, if you choose to
        expedite the assessment and receive the response within 20 days, you
        need to pay an additional <strong>325 Australian dollars</strong> on top
        of the original cost. In case of expiration and lapsing of the
        assessment by this organization, you don't need to resubmit all the
        documents. You only need to contact the organization for a
        re-assessment, and the cost is <strong>125 Australian dollars</strong>.
        Usually, a response is provided within 10 days for a re-assessment.
      </p>
      <h2>Australian Trades Recognition Authority (TRA)</h2>
      <p>
        The Trades Recognition Australia (TRA) is responsible for assessing and
        recognizing the equivalence of over 130 technical trades in Australia.
        Applicants must initially submit their documents to TRA for credential
        evaluation and assessment. TRA employs two methods for credential
        recognition and assessment.
      </p>
      <h3>OSAP Method</h3>
      <p>
        For fields such as toolmaking, welding, cabinet making, carpentry,
        installation, construction, cooking, casting, high-pressure welding,
        welding supervisor, hairstyling, carpentry services, steam boiler
        making, metal casting with machinery, shaping sheet metal in the
        workshop, the OSAP method should be used for the equivalence of
        educational documents. In this method, there is no need for an English
        language certificate, but the interview is conducted in English, and the
        applicant is not allowed to use a translator.

      <h3>MSA Method</h3>
      <p>
        If the applicants' field of study is outside of the aforementioned
        specialties, they can use the MSA method to assess their educational
        documents for Australia. In this method, English language proficiency is
        not required. The educational or work document must be comparable to at
        least an Australian diploma. Short courses or work experience or work
        registrations and licenses cannot replace the educational document.
        Also, the educational document must be approved by the Ministry of
        Science. Your document must be related to your work courses and work
        experience. This organization evaluates your work experience after the
        diploma. However, if you have work experience and proficiency in a
        profession and do not have the equivalent of an Australian university
        degree and at least a post-diploma, you can also gain 10 education
        points when filling out the EOI by doing an MPA evaluation, which is
        done after the assessment stage. Since the TRA does not have a
        fast-track method for evaluating files, the usual time it takes to
        evaluate files is about 3 to 4 months. In case the positive assessment
        expires, you must provide all the documents complete, updated, and from
        the beginning, as if it is the first time your documents are being
        evaluated.

      <h2>
        Australian Computer Society (ACS) Document Assessment Organization
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you have graduated in one of the computer engineering fields or have
        work experience directly related to computer engineering, and you want
        to immigrate to Australia through a work visa, you need to send your
        documents to the Australian Computer Society (ACS). ACS is responsible
        for assessing the documents of individuals who have graduated in one of
        the computer science specialties or have work experience in the field of
        computer science and IT. ACS or the Australian Computer Society assesses
        the documents to be equivalent to Australian qualifications.
        Fortunately, ACS does not require English language proficiency as a
        prerequisite for document evaluation. As a result, engineers or
        graduates in computer science and IT can expedite their migration
        process. The Australian Computer Society (ACS) initially examines your
        academic documents based on the level of education and units completed
        at the university. Then, it categorizes them into one of the following
        groups: <strong>ICT Major</strong>, <strong>ICT Minor</strong>, or
        <strong>None-ICT</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the <strong>ICT Major</strong> category, for postgraduate degrees,
          if your field aligns with your work experience,
          <strong>2 years of experience</strong> are required, and if it's
          different, <strong>4 years of work experience</strong> are needed. -
          In the <strong>ICT Minor</strong> category, with a bachelor's degree,
          depending on whether your qualification is relevant to your work
          experience or not, <strong>between 5 to 6 years</strong> of mandatory
          work experience is required. Microsoft and Cisco certifications
          usually fall into this category.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the <strong>ICT Minor</strong> category with a bachelor's degree or
          higher, depending on the qualification and work experience,
          <strong>between 5 to 6 years</strong> of work experience is required.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your qualification is a diploma or higher, and in the unit
          equivalence process, it does not fall into any of the above
          categories, you will be classified as <strong>None-ICT</strong>. For
          the assessment of your qualification by the <em>ACS</em>, you need
          <strong>6 years</strong> of Australian work experience along with
          <strong>2 RPL projects</strong>. (If your academic qualification is
          unrelated to computer science, at least <strong>6 years</strong> of
          work experience along with <em>RPL</em> must be provided to
          <em>ACS</em> to receive your assessment. In this case, the entire work
          experience is deducted, and you won't have the chance to claim points
          in the <em>EOI</em> stage.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Individuals seeking assessment by <em>ACS</em> with a diploma or lower
          must present <strong>8 years</strong> of work experience along with
          <strong>2 RPL projects</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition to all the mentioned requirements, it has been observed that
        <em>ACS</em> may deduct between <strong>2 to 8 years</strong> from your
        work experience. Therefore, including the above points in presenting
        work experience and collecting documents seems essential. It is also
        advisable to upload documents such as salary slips for each year to
        <em>ACS</em>. Your employment certificate must be on letterhead,
        stamped, and signed. All documents, including contracts, should be
        stamped and signed by the highest authority in the organization or the
        HR manager. <em>ACS</em> assessment results are valid for up to
        <strong>2 years</strong>. The cost of document assessment by this
        organization in 2023 is <strong>530 Australian dollars</strong>.
